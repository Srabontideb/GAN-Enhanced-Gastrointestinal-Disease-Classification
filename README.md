# GAN-Enhanced Gastrointestinal Disease Classification

This project explores the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to improve gastrointestinal (GI) disease classification from endoscopic images, particularly using the Kvasir v2 dataset.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

This repository contains whole work on a deep learning pipeline for GI image classification, aiming to:

- Enhance data diversity using GAN-generated synthetic samples.
- Improve classification accuracy on underrepresented disease classes.
- Apply preprocessing techniques to improve lesion visibility.
- Visualize model decision-making using explainability tools.

## ðŸ§° Components Implemented So Far

- âœ… Preprocessing with CLAHE and Gaussian Smoothing (Color and Contrast Normalization) -> MSRCR (Multi-Scale Retinex with Color Restoration) to further enhance lesions and mucosal textures -> Bilateral filtering to suppress compression artifacts.
- âœ… ConvMixer-based classifier with External Attention (for original dataset)
- âœ… Experiment with ConvNeXt-T, Swin Transformer and Vision Transformer with Attention Rollout.
- âœ… Initial setup for training using cosine annealing and CutMix Regularization.
- âœ… Grad-CAM-based post-processing visualization.
- âœ… Generating Accuracy, F1-score, AUC, Precision/Recall(for original data)
- ðŸ”„ (In progress) GAN-based data augmentation with StyleGAN2-ADA


ðŸ“Š Dataset
